# FULL-ANSWERS

Here are my answers to the course 'Introduction to Data Science in Python' by University of Michigan on Coursera.

There are three coding assignments in the course, all quite not easy.
I truly agree with many comments in the website at the end of this course, that this course unfriendly is way ahead of beginners and should be renamed as 'Applied Pandas lib of data processing and calculation.

However I found it very interesting to shuffle those pandas functions back and forth and to write python in a unique manner of PANDORABLE.

I would like to share these codes as well as correct answers to assignments here. Later maybe I will point out some lines in the code where worth paying great attention to.

A small example would be

`df7['diff']=df7.apply(lambda x:max(x)-min(x),axis=1)`

at cell 10 of Assignment 2.
